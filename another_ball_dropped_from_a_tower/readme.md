## Exercise 2.1: Another ball dropped from a tower

A ball is again dropped from a tower of height h with initial velocity zero. Write a
program that asks the user to enter the height in meters of the tower and then calculates
and prints the time the ball takes until it hits the ground, ignoring air resistance. Use
your program to calculate the time for a ball dropped from a 100 m high tower.
